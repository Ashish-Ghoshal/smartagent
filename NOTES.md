#  SmartAgent Project Notes

##  Current Version
- smartagent_v2.6_with_run_guide.zip
- Includes full memory-enabled controller
- Complete unsupervised learning suite
- Professional README and plain-English RUN_GUIDE

##  Next Steps
###  Phase 5: Time Series Support
- [ ] Create `analyze_time_series.py`: auto-detect datetime, frequency
- [ ] Add `decompose_time_series.py`: STL/trend/seasonality
- [ ] Build `forecast_time_series.py`: use ARIMA or ETS for future predictions
- [ ] Add `detect_time_anomalies.py`: z-score/rolling window for outlier detection
- [ ] Optional: LLM summary of trends and seasonal patterns

##  Other Considerations
- UI upload flow (optional)
- Persistent memory (v3.0 goal)
- Time series sample data for testing
